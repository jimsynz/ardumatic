# Ardumatic

Ardumatic is a small forward and inverse kinematics library suitable for use
inside Ardupilot.

It uses the [FABRIK]() algorithm to
get quickly generate inverse kinematic solutions.

# TODO
 - Implement FABRIK solver
 - Implement gait generator for n-legged robots

# Thanks to

This package couldn't exist without all the great people whose code I was able to read to get my head around what I was trying to do.
