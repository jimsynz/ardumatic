Ardumatic is a small forward and inverse kinematics library suitable for use
inside Ardupilot.

It uses the [FABRIK](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UNoX65PRehA) algorithm to
get quickly generate inverse kinematic solutions.

# TODO
 - Implement FABRIK solver
 - Implement gait generator for n-legged robots
